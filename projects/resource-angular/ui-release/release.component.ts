 * which on the login page is the methods list the login component reads. When this build
 * of the browser application names a release (API_VERSION) that is not the server's, a tab
 * kept open across a release until the update notice is taken, the line adds which build
 * the tab runs. Nothing about the application is named in it: the page puts its own name
 * beside it where it wants one. Put it under the login card and in the footer of every page.
