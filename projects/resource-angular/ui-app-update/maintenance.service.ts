 * the server still down doubling the wait up to MAINTENANCE_CHECK_CAP, no check while the
 * tab is hidden, and one as soon as it is visible again, with the timer outside Angular's
 * zone so it never keeps the application from settling. When the server answers without
 * the marker, whatever the status, the notice is dismissed and AppUpdateService.checkNow()
 * runs, so a new build installed meanwhile raises the update notice; the next request of
