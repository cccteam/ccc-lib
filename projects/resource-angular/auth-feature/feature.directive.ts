 * Renders its template while the named feature flag is on, and nothing while it is off:
 *
 *     <a *cccFeature="Feature.Debriefs" routerLink="/debriefs">Debriefs</a>
 *
 * The answer is AuthService.featureEnabled, from the enabled set loaded at sign-in, so
 * the view shows nothing before the set has loaded and follows a refresh of the set (the
 * person who flips a flag sees their own pages follow at once). No name renders
 * unconditionally, so a navigation item with no `feature` passes through. Pass the
 * generated `Feature` member, never a string literal: a misspelled flag then fails to
 * compile. For a feature with a resource behind it the digest alone hides the page, since
 * the server omits a gated-off resource from it; this directive is for the surfaces that
 * have no resource behind them.
