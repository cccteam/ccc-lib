/**
 * The login page's sign-in methods, rendered from what the server offers. On arrival the
 * component reads the methods list through the application's client and renders it: the
 * password form when the list has a password method, and one button per redirect method,
 * in the server's order; nothing it shows is named here, so the bundle is the same in
 * every environment and a method that is not registered has no button. The server's label
 * is the default for each method and `labels` overrides it by registration name; nothing
 * else about a method is the page's to change. Where the list says the password method's
 * username is the person's email address, the form asks for the address.
 *
 * It owns the journey from the list to the session. A password sign-in posts through the
 * client, which reads the list again first so the POST carries a live XSRF token; the
 * session established, the component checks it through AuthService (loading the digest,
 * the domains and the feature flags) and emits `signedIn` with the router URL of the page
 * to go to: the page the login guard turned away from, else `home`. The page navigates
 * there and starts whatever it starts on a sign-in (the idle service). A redirect method
 * sends the browser to the method's path, naming the same page as the one to return to;
 * the server's callback brings the browser back there signed in, or back to this page with
 * `?code=` for a refusal or `?pending=` for a step that waits.
 *
 * After a refusal, every redirect button asks the provider for its account chooser
 * (`prompt=select_account` on the method's path), so a person refused with the wrong
 * account picks another instead of being sent round the same loop by a provider that
 * signs its one signed-in account in again without asking; on a stop without a refusal, a
 * "Use a different account" button under each redirect button asks the same, and the
 * redirect button itself asks nothing, so the single-account person pays no click. An
 * arrival from a deep link, the guard having recorded the page, into an application whose
 * only method is a redirect forwards to it at once, rendering nothing: the provider signs
 * the person in and returns them to the page, an expired session included. The page
 * stops, with its buttons, when the guard recorded nothing (a direct visit, a bookmark, the
 * page sign-out lands on), when the URL carries a refusal code or a step or a mailed link's
 * token, when the list offers more than one method or a password, and when a session is
 * found standing.
 *
 * A refusal arriving in the URL renders the sentence the application holds for the code
 * (`LOGIN_MESSAGES`, through UiCoreService) and nothing for a code it does not know; one
 * the server answers on a step renders that sentence when its body carries a code, whatever
 * the status, and the server's words otherwise (a wrong password). A name whose failed
 * attempts reached the server's limit is refused with 429, `too_many_attempts` and the wait,
 * rendered after the sentence: "Too many attempts. Try again in 14 minutes."; the step it
 * was refused on stays where it is. A pending step, entered with `?pending=` or
 * answered to a password sign-in, is read from the pending status route and takes the
 * list's place: for a confirmation, the password form of the user the sign-in matched,
 * posting to the confirmation route, with a cancel that returns to the list; for a step
 * the server names a page for, the browser goes there. A sign-in held for the second
 * factor, when the policy accepts the mailed code (the status carries `emailCode`), runs
 * the code step: the code is mailed at once to the address the account holds, and the step
 * says where it went over the code field, a "Remember this browser" box, and a button for
 * a new code; a person whose account holds no address is asked for one first. A wrong code
 * (`invalid_code`) or one entered after the code sent died (`code_expired`) keeps the form
 * with its sentence; with the box checked, the server remembers the browser, and this
 * person's next sign-ins from it skip the code. A step this page does not render, a reason
 * it does not know or a second-factor step without the mailed code, shows the note that the
 * page is older than the server, asking for a reload, with the cancel; the steps the page
 * renders are declared in `SIGN_IN_STEPS` and, for the framework's release check, under
 * `cccteam.signInSteps` in the package's package.json.
 *
 * The mailed links the server sends all lead here, each with its token in the URL. An
 * invitation (`?invitation=`) is opened through the client on arrival and the card becomes
 * the invitation screen: "You're invited to <tenant>" and the address, over every way that
 * can accept this invitation for that address and none that cannot (`invitationPaths`). The
 * browser now carries the invitation, so the sign-in that follows accepts it and seats the
 * person with the roles it carried. A directory registration the server says could admit
 * the address (`methods`) is a "Continue with <label> as <address>" button, which sends the
 * address to the provider as its login hint, so the provider takes that account; the
 * server accepts a directory sign-in only as the invited address, refusing another with
 * `invitation_address`, and the screen then says so, naming the address. The password form
 * shows when an account with a password holds the address (`accountExists`, `hasPassword`),
 * with a note saying it accepts; and where no account holds the address and the server
 * offers a password method, the account form opens by itself, without a Cancel, but only
 * where no directory could admit the address, since the invited person has that account
 * already. "Use a different account" is not offered while an invitation stands: the
 * invitation names the account. A person the page finds already signed in accepts it with
 * one click, from a button under the heading. Under an older server that does not say what
 * holds the address every path is offered, the account form behind a "Create an account
 * with a password" button that comes last, under the password form and the redirect
 * buttons, where the open "Create an account" step stands when no invitation does. The
 * browser keeps carrying the invitation when a redirect method refuses the sign-in and
 * brings it back here with `?code=` and no token; the methods list then names the
 * invitation under `invitation.standing`, and the screen stands again, with the refusal's
 * sentence under it, so the person sees what they were invited to, the ways to sign in, and
 * why the last attempt was refused, together. A token in the URL is opened instead, which
 * also refreshes what the browser carries. A sign-up link
 * (`?signUp=`) is opened the same way and renders the account form in the list's place; the
 * list of a server whose password method offers sign-up also carries the "Create an account"
 * step, which asks for an address and mails it the link. A confirmation link (`?verify=`) is
 * posted once a session stands, on arrival when the page finds one, else after the
 * sign-in it waits for (a redirect method returns to this page with the token); the
 * component then shows what happened and emits `signedIn` on Continue. On every arrival
 * the component renders nothing until the reads have answered (`arriving`, which a page
 * holds its card back on, so a load shows nothing and then the whole card), so the form
 * shows only to a person found signed out; one found signed in goes straight on to what
 * the link asks for, or is offered Continue and Sign out, and is never shown a form first.
 * Reads that fail (no answer, or an answer with no words to show: a gateway's 502 or 504)
 * render the sentence held for `unreachable` and a Try again button in the list's place,
 * never the status; Try again runs the arrival again, the card held back meanwhile.
 *
 * A session the sign-in establishes may carry `passwordChangeRequired`: an operator set
 * the password, and the server serves nothing but the password change until the person
 * sets one of their own. The component then renders the change form in the list's place,
 * with the sentence the application holds for `password_change_required` over it, posts
 * the old and the new password through the client to the change path the methods list
 * names, checks the session again and emits `signedIn` with the page recorded at the
 * sign-in; a refusal (the old password did not match, the new one fails the server's
 * rule) is rendered in place. Cancelling the change ends the session and shows the list
 * again. Everything around the methods, the branding, a manifest, a forgotten-password
 * link, is the page's, composed around the component.
