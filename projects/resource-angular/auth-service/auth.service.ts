 * client's (RESOURCE_CLIENT, provided through provideResourceClient; an application
 * that provides none fails at startup naming the way in). One cache serves the app's
 * own pages and the library's guard, directive, and forms. The store holds the per-scope
 * permission digest (the session user's structural grant enumeration — granted,
 * conditional, or absent for denied) and the user's domains (every tenant where they
 * hold at least one grant — the tenant picker's source). On authentication the global
 * digest and the domains load once; a tenant's digest loads on demand (`loadDigest`)
 * and stays cached. Answers are advisory UI material — what to render — and fail
 * closed: nothing loaded means nothing permitted. Enforcement stays server-side.
