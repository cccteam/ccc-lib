/**
 * Session and permission state for the application.
 *
 * Permissions are owned by a @cccteam/resource PermissionStore: the application's
 * client's (RESOURCE_CLIENT, provided through provideResourceClient; an application
 * that provides none fails at startup naming the way in). One cache serves the app's
 * own pages and the library's guard, directive, and forms. The store holds the per-scope
 * permission digest (the session user's structural grant enumeration — granted,
 * conditional, or absent for denied) and the user's domains (every tenant where they
 * hold at least one grant — the tenant picker's source). On authentication the global
 * digest and the domains load once; a tenant's digest loads on demand (`loadDigest`)
 * and stays cached. Answers are advisory UI material — what to render — and fail
 * closed: nothing loaded means nothing permitted. Enforcement stays server-side.
 *
 * Live pages ride the same session: when the application provides a change feed
 * (CHANGE_FEED) and the client's API serves live subscriptions, the first authenticated
 * answer starts the client's live session with it, and a logout stops it (unsubscribing
 * everything and revoking the feed's identity) before the session itself is logged out.
 *
 * Feature flags ride it too: the first authenticated answer loads the enabled set beside
 * the digest, `featureEnabled` answers from it for the `cccFeature` directive, the
 * `featureMatch` route guard, and the application's own code, and a logout forgets it.
 * The set is loaded at sign-in and not polled: a flip by someone else is seen at the next
 * sign-in, while the person flipping, through the feature flags dialog, has their own set
 * and digest refreshed once the write succeeds. An API that serves no feature flags (its
 * descriptor carries no features route) loads nothing: every flag answers off, so each
 * gate stays closed, and the dialog says the API serves none.
