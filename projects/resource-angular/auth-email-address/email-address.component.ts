 * while they hold none) and offers to add or change it where the server sends mail: the
 * methods list names the email routes. The person types an address and the server mails
 * it a confirmation link; nothing is written until the link is followed on the login page,
 * so an address never attaches to an account its follower does not control, and the
 * screen says the link is on its way whatever the address's state (an address another
 * account holds is told so by mail). A refusal (not an address; too many links to one
 * mailbox, with the wait) is rendered in place.
