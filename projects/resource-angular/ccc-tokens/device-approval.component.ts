 * from the `userCode` query parameter of the route, the link the program printed; with a
 * code it looks the request up and shows which program asks, for which outlet and until
 * when, with Approve and Deny; without one it asks for the code the program printed, in
 * any case and spacing, and looks it up on Continue. After a decision it says so; when no
 * request waits on the code, expired or already answered, it says so and asks for a code
 * again. A refusal of a decision is shown in place in the server's words. Where the
 * descriptor carries no tokens block, the page says in one sentence that the application
 * issues none.
 *
 * The page belongs at the application's device verification path (`/device` by default,
 * what the program prints), behind the sign-in guard, so a signed-out person returns to
 * it, code and all, after signing in.
