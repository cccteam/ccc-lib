/**
 * The user-management page over one partition of an Auth's surface. The component
 * configures itself from the descriptor's `userSurfaces` block: `auth` names the surface
 * (the first one by default) and `domain` binds the tenant partition, the global one when
 * it is omitted. Nothing about the application is named here; what the page offers
 * follows from the surface's shape and the caller's grants.
 *
 * The table has one row per user: the username, the email address and whether the person
 * confirmed it, the status, how they sign in, their roles one per line (each by its title,
 * `FeatureAdministrator` reading "Feature Administrator", with where it reaches beside it
 * where the application has tenants: "Everywhere" for a global role, "Every tenant" for a
 * seat held in every tenant, the tenant's name in its partition) and the last sign-in. A
 * row the directory seats says so. Each row ends in a menu button that names every action
 * the caller may take on that user: Edit access, Rename, Change email address, Set a
 * temporary password, Forget remembered browsers, Unlink for each linked sign-in method,
 * then Disable or Enable and Delete; an action the caller may not take is not listed.
 *
 * Edit access opens a side panel on the right listing the user's roles, one per row with
 * where it reaches and its description under it, a trash can per row and a button for
 * another role. Each row acts at once: choosing a role in a new row seats it in one call,
 * and the trash can asks in a dialog, then unseats in one call; the page is read again
 * after each, so the rows say what the server says, and Done closes the panel. On the
 * global page a seat held in every tenant is a row like the others, seated and unseated
 * through the global seats resource, and in the tenant partition it is shown locked. A
 * role the caller may not change, or a seat the directory writes, is shown with the
 * reason under it and cannot be removed; where the caller may seat but the user holds
 * every role there is, the panel says so where the add button would be. The picker is a
 * searchable list: typing narrows it by title, name and description.
 *
 * Every other action is one step with one call: Rename, Change email address (an
 * operator's entry is unverified and reserves the address) and Set a temporary password
 * (where the Auth has a password method) each open a dialog with its one field and its
 * one button; Forget remembered browsers (where the caller may run the reset method),
 * Unlink, Disable or Enable and Delete ask once in a dialog and then make their call.
 * Nothing can half-succeed. Where the password method declares the username as the
 * address, the username column is the address and neither is edited by hand: a verified
 * new address renames the person. The new-user panel takes the account fields and the
 * roles, one required in the tenant partition, whose create seats the new user in the
 * tenant.
 *
 * Below the users stand the partition's invitations, where the descriptor names the
 * resource: an address invited to hold roles, until whoever follows the mailed link signs
 * in and is seated with them, or the invitation is revoked or expires.
 *
 * Every control follows a capability: the digest decides whether users are created, seats
 * written and invitations sent, and the row's capability envelope, asked for on every
 * read, decides the rename, the disable, the delete, the methods and the revoke per row.
 * A refusal, by the server or by the network, is shown in place in the server's words,
 * and the lists are read again after every write so the rows say what the server says.
